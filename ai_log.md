**Prompt**: "i want to create an asp.net core pure web api based application. but i want to maintain clean arc. were 1 project will be web api project and rest of the 3 will be library project(application, domain, infra.). i want to do it in mac with vs code. i also want to use sqlite for db. now tell me how to create the project, how to set up the db (i will use dbeaver), how to build connection between all projects. if you have any query then ask first, after then give me answer."

**Result**: from install the .net sdk to project creation, db set up and other related thing, ai provided step by step.

**My Changes**: i just verify each step from google search and if i found any mismatch or latest efficient method i follow.

**Why it works**: I thing these are very basic and common things, mentioned in the official guidelines. so most of the instrucitons are correct enough.


**Prompt**: "[copy of full MainActivity.kt file's code] i need the same thing for ios with setup instuction step by step. mention file name (with path) where i need to change code"

**Result**: code snippet with step by step instruction to get data from ios end to flutter end.

**My Changes**: i follow the official guideline of flutter method channel and try to identify are both instuction similar or not. i take code from ai and following the official guideline i successfully get the data from ios to flutter.

**Why it works**: because it follows the official guideline of flutter method channel (both android and ios).
